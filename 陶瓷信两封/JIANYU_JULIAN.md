Dear professor McAuley,

My name is Jianyu Wang, an incoming MS CS75 student at UCSD. Being fascinated with your research area Personalized Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing, and with a strong intention to contribute to more rigorous research, I'm writing this email to express my sincere desire for a potential research opportunity to work in your group during my MS study. I really hope that I could join your group as a PhD student in the future! 

The reasons that I think your group really fits me are summarized as follows:

1) My initial research goal is very similar to your PhD students: Shuyang Li and Bodhisattwa Prasad Majumder. I also aim to build empathetic, sensible and personalized interactive systems, especially Conversational Recommendation System. Furthermore, I also hope I could equip the CRS with the multimodal intelligence techniques.

2) Dreams about doing creative, ground-breaking and enjoyable research: my first key research, DualVGR, is about single-turn QA in Chinese NLPR, like VideoQA. This research work is prepared to be published in IEEE Transactions on Multimedia (TMM 2021), and I gain much research experience from this work. However, I am not very satisfied due to my lack of knowledge and enough training. UC San Diego AI community is a great chance for me to hone my skills, and if I could learn in your group, I could realize my dream step by step.

3) Highly Self-motivated, Hardworking and strong quantitative, analytical and programming skills: With years of dedicated learning, I now have a complete knowledge set in computer science and electronics engineering. My Overall GPA is 93.1/100 (ranking 2/271) in my bachelor study. Besides, my major GPA is 96.6/100 (14 major courses 98+, with experimental courses) or 97/100 (without experimental courses), which is the highest major GPA in 5 year's history in my university. In order to hone my skills of programming, I also participated in the Alibaba Cloud Tianchi Anonymous News Text Classification, and achieved solo ranking 4/2184. My github stars of this project is 104 now, and my technique report is shared via many wechat accounts, like Tianchi, NewBeeNLP, etc. I, being invited as a guest-speaker, also did the live broadcast to introduce one NLP book on three platforms, including Tianchi, Bilibili, and epubit in China. Although you mention that MS students should take CSE258 at first, I have already understood the techniques in CSE258. I also found the CSE291 Trends in RecSys course website, and I guarantee that I will try to read all the mentioned papers during these days.

I don't have a very clear research proposal now, but I promise I will try my best to contribute to the group during my MS study. I am wondering if I could have the great chance to join your group during my MS study, as I really do hope to work under your instructions. It would be very appreciated if you could reply to this email at your earliest convenience. I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely yours,
Jianyu Wang
