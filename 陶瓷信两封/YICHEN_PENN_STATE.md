Dear professor Gowda,

My name is Yichen Liu, a junior student at Huazhong University of Science and Technology, School of ECE. Being fascinated with your research area Internet of Things and Mobile Edge Computing, and with a strong intention to contribute to more rigorous research, I'm writing this email to express my sincere desire for a potential summer internship opportunity to work in your research group. I have already acquired a B1/B2 visa, and I will take care of all my personal expenses. I will be fully available from the end of June to December, 2020.

With years of dedicated learning, I now have a complete knowledge set in computer science and electronics engineering. My current GPA is 3.83/4.0, ranked in the top 5% in my major.

As for my research experience, I have spent plenty of time on the design on Privacy-Preserving Online Learning Algorithm, IoT and Edge Computing, and I've been searching information among professors whose research area falls on relative topics. I'm extremely lucky to have read your paper IoT Platform for Sports Analytics, which I found really informative and illuminating. Below is my key research:

I devised a new approach to apply Contextual Multi-armed Bandit Algorithm to optimize the real-time energy exchange in smart buildings which also guarantees Differential Privacy for users. I have finished a first-author paper on this project and it is currently under review of IEEE IoT Journal.
I successfully developed an end-to-end pipeline as a Fake News Detector that ingests raw text data and determine its validity, using NLP techniques.
I constructed a neural network for Breast Cancer Image Recognition based on Deep Learning that accurately distinguishes benign and malignant tumors.
Given the above project experience, I have acquired good capabilities in programming and algorithm development, and I'm very eager to receive more training in theories and technical tools in the field of IoT and Edge Computing.

I am wondering if you still have positions for a summer intern, as I really do hope to join in your research group and work under your instructions. It would be really appreciated it if you could reply to this email at your earliest convenience. I'm looking forward to hearing from you soon.

Sincerely yours,

Yichen Liu
